      From time to time, I write a few words I hope are worth sharing and post
      them here.


      Along with my own work, I'll be posting things I've found along the way:
      Videos, worthwhile links, or just sites I believe you'll enjoy.

      This is the "about" excerpt. It can be used to provide a paragraph about
      yourself that people can read on the homepage to get a sense of who you
      are. There also exists a dedicated about page where you can write more
      about yourself for those who are interested.
