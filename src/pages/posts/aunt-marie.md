<p>I wonder if you have an Aunt Marie?  I don't mean specifically an aunt or even someone named Marie, but when I was a child this role I speak of was filled by my beloved Aunt Marie DeWitt.  Aunt Marie was the one my Mother took me to visit when she was worried for my heart; worried for my soul.  When mere discipline or the predictable encouragement of a parent was not quite enough, I'd find myself on the road to my Aunt &amp; Uncle's home.  (I still have clear memories of their long drive.)</p>

<p>What Marie had was something I hope each of you have in your life.  She had a way of speaking softly, but directly to my heart.  A gentle, "Sit down please, I'd like to speak with you." stopped me in my tracks and my soul payed attention to her message.  Even when her message was to correct my heart, and the tears flowed, I left feeling encouraged and uplifted.  My heart felt lighter after our chats, even when they were to be followed by much work.  (I recall an afternoon spent pulling thistles from Aunt Marie's yard after I had been particularly problematic...)</p>

<p>Can you recall moments like that?  Moments where someone seized your attention with gentle authority and challenged you, "Sit down please.  I'd like to speak with you."  Life is busy with all sorts of trouble, yet somehow you pause, and pay attention.  I have found these moments grow easier to ignore the busier we make ourselves.  I have also found when I become too busy with the unimportant, God has a way of sitting me down.</p>

<p>Life has dealt me a bit of change lately.  A university contract terminated far sooner than I'd dreamed left me wondering, "Alright Lord, what next?"  Don't misunderstand me, I'm aware the blame for the change rests as much with me as anyone else.  I am also aware that we are a bit too quick to go looking for blame when we ought be looking for the bigger message.</p>

<p>One afternoon last week, I'm working on preparing for the future (Courtney and I are enrolled in class to become Real Estate Agents.  Exciting and scary!) when a tune I've not heard before plays in our home.  "<em>Sit down please.  I'd like to speak with you.</em>"  I pause, and drink in every word:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00ffff;"><em>"Grander Earth has quaked before, moved by the sound of His voice.  Seas that are shaken and stirred, can be calmed and broken for my regard.</em></span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00ffff;"><em>Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on You</em></span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00ffff;"><em>It is well with me.</em></span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00ffff;"><em>Far be it from me to not believe, even when my eyes can't see; and this mountain that's in front of me, will be thrown into the midst of the sea.</em></span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00ffff;"><em>Through it all, through it all, my eyes are on You.  Through it all, through it all, it is well.</em></span></p>

<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #00ffff;"><em>So let go my soul and trust in Him,  the waves and wind still know His name."</em></span></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Like the words of Aunt Marie, these contain no surprises.  Rather, they give a gentle reminder of the truth I already know.  This, can be calmed and broken for my regard.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">I hope you have an Aunt Marie in your life.  Perhaps for you this role is filled by a grandparent, an old teacher, a life long friend or mentor.  Perhaps it is someone you haven't spoken with in ages.  Whomever it is, I hope you'll reach out and thank them.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Whatever storm you face today, from whatever cause, "The waves and wind still know His name!"  Be encouraged.  Take a seat.  Hear the message of encouragement prepared for you today.</p>
