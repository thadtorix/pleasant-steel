<p>Took in a sermon this morning at First Baptist of Joplin, MO. One of the more profound moments of the message was the pastor comparing the love of a Mother to the love of God.</p>

<p>"These two statements are foundational in the body of Christ," He said. "I love you." and "I forgive you." He went on to tell a tale of a child who had experienced a falling out with his mother, and that child's experience of reconciling with her. I'm not sure what else the pastor said this morning, because I spent the rest of the morning taken back in time to my early teenage years.</p>

<p>We lived in a small town in Southern Idaho where everyone knew everybody else's business. My parents were good to us kids and probably gave me more freedom than a teenage boy should have. It was around that time things came to a head. I don't even recall what I was upset about. If I were gambling on it, I'd bet it had something to do with a girl. Although I can't say for sure what we were arguing over, I AM certain it was not worth being as angry as I was. Screaming. Slamming doors. And then, I did it.</p>

<p>I left.</p>

<p>"I'll show them." I thought. Although I don't recall all the details, I do remember going first to our little church where I hid out a bit before I eventually ended up at a friend's house. I don't even remember if I stayed the night or went home that evening.</p>

<p>While my memory of that story is full of blank spaces, I do recall one thing with certainty. When I left that evening, I hurt my mother. I hurt her in a way that struck deep inside.</p>

<p>I've got kids of my own now, and have been a parent for nearly 16 years. Looking back at my behavior back then makes me furious. If I were to encounter a boy pulling the same stunt now, he'd be lucky to make it back to his folks alive.</p>

<p>I really don't know if Mother felt anger that evening, but if she did, it never showed. When I came home, forgiveness was mine before I could even ask. On that day, I thought She and Dad had spared me from their wrath. I now understand, they spared me from truly seeing the hurt I had so carelessly inflicted.</p>

<p>I deserved punishment. She handed down love and forgiveness. In truth, I've received those two gifts from my mother more times than I can count. There's a long list of moments in life where I've proven myself exceptionally selfish, and still she calls to encourage and remind me of her love.</p>

<p>On this Mother's Day, I am thankful for a Mother who has shown me so much love and forgiveness, often simultaneously.</p>

<p>By the way... It was no coincidence that the first place I ran to was our church. Long before I ran off, Mom taught me where to look for answers when life becomes overwhelming.</p>

<p>Happy Mother's Day Mom. I'll never have the words to tell you just how much I appreciate you.</p>
