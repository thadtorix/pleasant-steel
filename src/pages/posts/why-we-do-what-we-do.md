<p>I could give you a dozen reasons not to be a law enforcement officer. Most veteran cops could give you fifty. It makes sense really. Signing up for this job means volunteering to spend most of your time dealing with people at their worst. Pay, Schedule, Politics, the list of ugliness goes on and on. Maybe the most compelling reason is bitterness. Lately it seems no matter which way you look in public safety, cops, medics, firemen, nurses, etc., you'll find large groups of people with one of two common dislocation injuries: Dislocated shoulders from patting ourselves on the back rambling on and on and on and on about how great and selfless we are (as if we were drafted into these duties??), or dislocated jaws from all the whining and complaining about how rough it is on the street (Again, I don't recall anyone forcing me to take this career path...). It is easy to become a bit disillusioned or jaded, to forget what the idea of true service is really all about. I'm as guilty, more so probably, as the next guy of complaining without a point. Every now and then though, if I'm paying attention, I get a reminder of what this role of public servant is really all about.</p>

<p>A month or two ago, fellow officers and I responded to one of several domestic disturbance calls in town. Keeping things safe means a quick protective search of the home to be sure we have eyes on all the players in this evening's assault on the family. It's hot. I'm tired. There's a hundred places I'd rather be. I've been on this call a hundred times this year I'd swear. Bad guy is in handcuffs and I'm making my way through this humble cluttered home, noting the usual: empty bottles of booze strewn across the furniture and floor, chairs overturned, holes in doors and walls - no doubt there's been a heck of a fight here this evening. I notice a streak of the victim's blood in the hallway and can already hear her defending the suspect as another officer interviews her.</p>

<p>One last room to check and I'm out of here. I hear a faint noise and train my pistol on the doorway. "Show me your hands!" I shout as I advance and then quickly holster my pistol as the source of the sound has become more clear. On a filthy mattress, surrounded by garbage, is a pile of blankets. Not blankets you'd want to sleep under. More like dirty, old blankets you'd expect to find in a landfill. Slowly, I crouch down near this bed and pull back the blankets covering the soft weeping of tiny five year old Saryn. The fear in her eyes grips me much quicker than the dirt and grime on her face and clothes. This isn't her first night of terror. If I have anything to say about it, it will be her last.</p>

<p>Saryn explains to me what she has seen and heard, more grown up than kids twice her age. I'm suddenly thankful for the microphone on my shirt recording her words; mere ink could never convey the hopelessness in her voice. I pray this audio recording makes it to trial.</p>

<p>"Tonight, you are safe." I offer my hand as I tell her about my little girls at home. Saryn skips my open hand, wraps her arms around my neck, and her tears flow freely. A few tears of my own escape as I pick this little child up and head for the front door.</p>

<p>After I've carried Saryn out to safety, it's time to focus on the coward in the back of my patrol car. Like most manipulators, he has something to say on the way to jail, "You gonna hit me?" he taunts.</p>

<p>"I sure am," I reply, "but not with fists or a club like you might think. No sir, I'm going to hit you harder than you've ever been struck with something we call a Probable Cause Statement."</p>

<p>This call generated hours of un-paid overtime for me, and ordinarily I'd be whining about it. Not today. Today I've had a clear reminder that it was not pay, nor applause that drew me to this job - a reminder that I have nothing to complain about. Today, my kids get a little stronger hug from their big cry baby of a father, and we remember little Saryn when we say our bedtime prayers.</p>

<p>The days to come find me remembering this fragile little girl with her arms around my neck, and me trying a bit harder to remember why I do what I do. I'm blessed to have this job, and to have it along side some of the best in the business. Sometimes we're rough and mean. Sometimes we're kind and gentle. On occasion, we're both in the same call.</p>
