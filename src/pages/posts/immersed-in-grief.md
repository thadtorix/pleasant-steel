<p>I've considered writing about this call for years, and am just now finding the time right to put this memory to words.  As I sit down to type, I do my best to work that lump out of my throat.  Truth is, this has taken some time to write, and I doubt mere words will adequately explain just how this felt.  I'm still not convinced I'm finished revising it.  Most all of the details have, of course, been changed.</p>

<p>It's been years ago, and while I have responded to calls which were more horrific or gory, this one has stuck with me.  One of several ambulances responding to a busy highway, with just as many paramedics, our patient was a passenger in a high speed collision.  Her injuries were significant, with initial assessments pointing to a closed head injury, internal bleeding, and a myriad of less-threatening injuries. Transport time by ground was faster than it would have been to utilize one of the many nearby aircraft, which meant I'd be caring for our critically injured patient for the duration of the 30 minute transport.</p>

<p>The fact that our patient refused to speak was not helping at all.  I hated that she wouldn't speak, but I couldn't blame her.</p>

<p>For you to understand her silence, I'll bring you back to the scene of the crash.  Many of the luxuries of a hospital are just not possible in the EMS environment, and one of those luxuries is the ability to keep some of the more disturbing sights out of view.  We do our best, but when multiple patients need rapid transport, a plain flat sheet draped over a body is often the best we can manage.</p>

<p>On this day, as we wheeled our patient to the ambulance, we came within a few feet of what was clearly the body of a child.  Although covered by a sheet, there was no mistaking the long blonde hair that lay on the highway, just a few inches longer than the sheet trying to hide the painful reality underneath.  The on-scene crew confirmed our fears, the deceased was the daughter of our patient.</p>

<p><em>As I type this, I wonder:  As you read the above paragraph, did you imagine a specific child under that sheet?  I did.  My own children were of the same age.  Sometimes grief hits faster than others.</em></p>

<p>With no time to spare, we loaded up, and departed for the nearest trauma center.</p>

<p>"Ma'am.  My name is Thad, and I'm going to take care of you on the way to the hospital." I've started a thousand assessments the same way.</p>

<p>"Is my little girl dead?" Her question pierced my heart.</p>

<p>"My priority right now is to take care of you, I'm not sure what the status of the other patients is." <em>I lied</em>. "Let's focus on your injuries right now, okay?"</p>

<p>"I'm not speaking another word until you tell me if my daughter is alive or not."  I hoped she was bluffing.</p>

<p>She wasn't.</p>

<p>I did as much of an assessment as possible without any feedback from her, but it was critical that I get her answers to a handful of questions.  Questions about her level of consciousness, her medical history, and questions about what she could feel in that moment.  Important questions.  Ignored questions.</p>

<p>With twenty-five minutes left in the trip, I had a decision to make:  Tell her or not?</p>

<p>In EMS for more than 20 years, from rookie to flight medic and everything in-between, this was a dilemma I had not considered nor encountered before.  The clinician in me wanted to withhold the truth, for fear the news would cause such an escalation in her it would make any bleeding worse.  The parent in me knew I would want to know.  Bad news does not get better with age.</p>

<p>I plead with her.  "Please, Ma'am, I can't give you the best care if you won't communicate with me."  I hoped maybe she'd let me off the hook.  I looked for reasons not to be the bearer of this terror.</p>

<p>She wouldn't budge.  I had hoped to pass this decision to someone else.  Someone more qualified, more prepared, more experienced.  Someone who was very much <em>more</em> than me.</p>

<p>I took her hand and spoke as softly as I could without bursting into tears myself.  "I'm really very sorry.  Your daughter has died."</p>

<p>I had more words of comfort to offer, but they were not heard.  As if she had been storing up all the answers to my questions regarding her level of awareness, she briefly answered them and paused.</p>

<p>She took a breath or two, and then it came.  The mourning sounds of a grieving parent, I've heard before.  The torment expressed by this mother rang in my ears for the remainder of our trip.  I fail to come up with words to describe the agony I witnessed during the last twenty minutes of that call.  I promise this:  It was a greater pain than most anyone can imagine.  I've delivered this sort of news more times than I can remember.  This was the first time I was the only one in the room with them, and the first time I couldn't excuse myself and escape the sounds of a parent realizing their greatest fears have come true.</p>

<p>I've mentioned this call, this decision, to paramedic students and colleagues in the years that have passed since then.  I've heard from some who say I should have waited, or not answered at all.  I've heard from others who are certain they'd have done the same thing.  I can tell you, I was anything but certain in that moment.</p>

<p>A long time mentor and paramedic instructor of mine once told me delivering this sort of hard news allows our patients to begin the grieving process, and delaying such news only impedes their ability to mourn properly.  I don't disagree with him, but I think this should also be taught:  this terrible task may be the worst part of any public servant's job.</p>

<p>When I think of grief, I think of this call.  And when I remember this day, I think of my partner, who had no choice but to drive as quickly as possible, and fight back their own tears as they listened in on the events unfolding in the back.  Believe me when I tell you it was as bad if not worse in the driver's seat, as it was in mine.</p>

<p>I put this story up here, not for pity or attention.  Rather, perhaps some would-be paramedic or EMT will stumble along this page as they consider entering a profession which will, from time to time, immerse them in grief.  I pray you'll consider this, and pursue this worthy role.  I pray you'll have instructors who are careful enough to train you how to handle such situations with compassion.  Most of all, I pray you'll take care of your own mental health after the remarkably difficult calls.</p>
