<p>I've written about the attitude of EMS providers in the past. Just like then, this post is spurred by my own attitude, or in this case, my skewed perspective. This is a true story, and it took place this afternoon in my office.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>Sometimes all it takes to turn around a day of frustration/aggravation is a ten minute conversation with a student who is looking for the reasons EMS is still a profession worth entering. I was answering her questions, but it was me who needed to listen to the words coming out of my mouth.</p>

<p>One of the highest scoring students in our EMT class, this student has spent a few shifts riding with various local ambulance services (no less than three different agencies). In more than one of those shifts, she heard some troubling advice: "Do NOT go to paramedic school." You all know the reasons that followed: Pay, working conditions, too many hours, schedule, etc.</p>

<p>In the past, I've been the paramedic guilty of telling students not to go to paramedic school. "Go to nursing school, you'll make more money..." was just one of many "reasons" I and many of my colleagues, listed.</p>

<p>Looking back, the only <em>real</em> reason I could have justly offered in steering a student away from this industry would have sounded like this: "<em>Well, you see, this profession is full of people who have allowed circumstance to distract us away from what we are really doing here. We'll find whatever reason to justify our own bitter perspective. Administration, system abusing patients, boring transfers; the list never ends. People who have forgotten why they came to this profession in the first place...... People just like me.</em>"</p>

<p>Honestly, those type of people should be ignored, or at least their bitterness should be. Ask those same people to tell you, not about their "worst call," but instead about the calls that made them feel the best about the care they had provided.  Ask them about the time they comforted another human soul who felt all was lost.  Ask them about the time they rejoiced to hear the cry of a baby as it clearly and unmistakably proved its airway was very much open.  Ask them about delivering a child, or shaking the hand of a man who had no pulse when they first met.  Just maybe, you'll see the reason that led them to starting paramedic school in the first place.</p>

<p>The reasons for entering EMS are as true today than they were when our young profession first started, perhaps more now than ever.  We can find bitterness in almost every industry.  Nurses, physicians, engineers, I'd dare say you could even find professional athletes that would have a list of reasons not to join their ranks.</p>

<p>I'd like to tell you that more than 20 years after I started my EMS career in a tiny town in Idaho, that I am immune to losing track and allowing my perspective to be clouded by own complaints, but I cannot make such a claim.  I suppose none of us are immune.  This job, like others, can be extremely frustrating.</p>

<p>This job, unlike most, brings with it opportunities for greatness worthy of movie scripts.  If you're young, images of heroic rescues and successful resuscitation efforts come quickly to your mind.  If you've been doing this long, and you have managed to keep a clear perspective, you know that many of the best moments of EMS are much simpler. Being an EMS provider means getting invited into a persons home and having the privilege to answer the question sometimes spoken, but more often evident in facial expression:  "Are they going to be okay?"  Even less notable, but just as important, are the countless encounters where you will provide little more than a ride between points A and B.  In those moments, your kindness to the patient makes a far larger impact than you can likely imagine.</p>

<p>On the high speed accident scene, on the transfer, at the cardiac arrest, at the average nursing home call, at the station, in the office, and most certainly in the classroom, we EMS providers choose each day:  Be a burden, or be a blessing. Make no mistake:  You will be one or the other, and the decision lies only with you.</p>

<p><em>"Our profession needs more people like you."</em>  I explained.  <em>"More people with fresh perspective and hearts full of compassion and kindness.  We need people like you who are trained by veteran providers wise enough to see that new providers must be taught to fight off bitterness and other lousy selfish complaints.  We need people like you to join our ranks and answer this calling in a manner far better than we have so far."</em></p>

<p>My meeting with this student was the last thing on my agenda for the day.  I let too many things get to me today, let my perspective get clouded a bit with things that just don't matter so much.  On my drive home I couldn't help but wonder if perhaps my reminder to keep a fresh perspective did her as much good as it did me.</p>

<p>When that student climbs in your truck, do us all a favor and stop telling them to do something else.  We need them. We need a fresh perspective as bad as we've ever needed anything.  Instead, lend them your wisdom.  Tell them how they can make this profession better.  Tell them about the moments where you and your team shined.  Tell them about the difficult moments when the best you could offer was to help another cope.  Tell them how to be the EMS professional you'd like to work with, or work for.</p>

<p>I've got just as much work to do tomorrow as ever, and I refuse to let the frustrations of life keep me from giving the best I've got.  I'd bet you can do the same.</p>
