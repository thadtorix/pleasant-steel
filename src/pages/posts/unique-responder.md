<In most all of my stories, the names are changed.  In this one, Nathan is in fact the actual name of one of my closest friends and one of the best responders I've ever worked with.>

<p>I started a career in EMS in 1994 at the age of 18. Since that time I’ve worked as an EMT, an Advanced EMT, a Paramedic, a Flight Paramedic, a Police Officer, and even a few years in there somewhere as a 911 dispatcher. In the time that has passed since then and now, like so many others, I’ve seen my share of gore and heartache and tragedy. I’ve told more people than I can count that their loved ones are gone, and on a few occasions those loved ones have been their young children. I’ve spent 45 minutes in an ambulance caring for a critically wounded woman who spent the entire time in wailing as she had just learned her daughter was killed in the same accident. The stress I’ve endured and been a part of is, in all honesty, not near as much as so many other veteran medics or officers I’ve had the pleasure of serving alongside.</p>

<p>In fact, the most agonizing stress I’ve been a part of was not on scene at all. It wasn’t at a hospital or even in a home delivering the worst news. It was, on a weekend morning in the basement of Cox Medical Center North in Springfield, Missouri. Nathan Preston, was my partner in dispatch, and had been my friend for years (He still is). I don’t remember all of the details of the call Nathan took that morning. I remember that he was the call taker and I was the dispatcher. Having done my part of sending the ambulance towards the residence, the only thing left for me to do was to listen in. I listened as Nathan gave what we call “Pre-Arrival Instructions” to the father of an infant who had found his boy lifeless that morning.</p>

<p>The sound of that father following Nathan’s calm instruction will never be erased from my memory. “…twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.” Followed by the sound of breaths being delivered and then his father’s pleading, “C’mon buddy, breathe!” as he resumed chest compressions.</p>

<p>In town, when the ambulance is nearby, a minute feels like five. In a rural area, ten minutes feels like a lifetime. Over and over again Nathan calmly instructed the caller. Over and over again the caller followed those instructions, attempting resuscitation in a situation that would prove to end just as we feared it would. The ambulance arrived, and after a time, a coroner was requested.</p>

<p>The rest of the morning was spent in difficult silence.</p>

<p>In every role I have held, I’ve been able to take action. Always. In each situation I’ve been able to offer something more than mere words. Even in moments of hopelessness and great loss, I’ve at least been there and able to offer something, even if was little more than a comforting presence in the moment. Except as a dispatcher. I’m not certain there are words to describe the feeling of being completely aware of the details of an emergency, while being powerless to physically intervene, and then also being disconnected from the call when units arrive on scene.</p>

<p>True, the 911 dispatcher does learn the outcomes and is a vital part of the team. They are invited to critical stress debriefings and, when the system works well, are offered the same support as the rest of the responders. Still, their unique calling is undeniable. Their faces rarely known to those who call, the 911 dispatchers continue to answer, never knowing what waits on the other side of that ringing line. Answering that line is like some sort of sick game of roulette, where some calls are misplaced, some are for anything other than an emergency, and some are for life hanging in the balance.</p>

<p>It’s been over a decade since that weekend shift in dispatch. Nathan is now the director of a 911 center in Texas and my wife is a 911 dispatcher at our local communications center. Both of their centers, like most others, celebrate this as National Public Safety Telecommunicator Week. They’ll have all sorts of functions, plenty of fun, and a chance to be thanked for what they do. These things are greatly needed, but I would dare you to give them something more. Give them the respect they deserve for a career of service truly like no other, bringing with it a stress rarely understood by anyone not among their ranks.</p>

<p>Hold off just a moment on that criticism for dispatch. Remember that while you only have to put up with talking with them, they have to put up with talking with an entire bunch of people just like you, on top of answering all of those 911 calls!</p>
