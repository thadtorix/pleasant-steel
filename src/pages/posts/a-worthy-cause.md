<p>A week or two ago, I gave brief closing remarks at our EMT &amp; Fire Academy graduation.&nbsp; Apparently, it wasn't awful, so I'll share it here:</p>

<p>-------</p>

<p>Some time ago, each of you entered into an agreement with those of us charged with your education.&nbsp; You believed that when an emergency occurs there ought to be someone there who knows what to do, and that somebody might as well be you.</p>

<p>Your attraction to this line of work is easy enough to understand.&nbsp; Flashing lights &amp; sirens cause traffic to move out of the way, while you experience the adrenaline rush that comes from being able to help someone during their emergency.&nbsp; Often times, the hardest part of the day is washing a rig that was, well, already clean, and almost every day involves taking a nap.&nbsp; I suppose it's true what they say, "when this job is easy, it's real easy."</p>

<p>On the other hand, your time in the field has brought with it some unforgiving truths.&nbsp; Sometimes that car crash scene is not exciting at all, rather, it is filled with the evidence that a fragile human life is no match for the unforgiving laws of mass and velocity.&nbsp; Some days bring the harshest of calls, causing us to face the reality that you were taught child and infant CPR for a reason.</p>

<p>It is difficult to convey the emotion felt by a public servant who stands in a home, surrounded by a family wondering if there is any hope for their loved one, knowing their fears are about to be confirmed.</p>

<p>It is also true, what they say, "when this job is hard, it is difficult to imagine anything being much harder."</p>

<p>Still, here you are, ready and willing to accept the demands of this business.&nbsp; However, you are new.&nbsp; Starting out, it will be difficult to find a job with so little experience.&nbsp; Along the way there will be plenty of people that can't wait to remind you of this.&nbsp; Along that same path, you will see plenty of professionals that have found success as a public servant.&nbsp; Each of those people have one thing in common; at some point they were brand new, with very little experience and they refused to hear the discouragement from those who would tell them why they could not succeed.</p>

<p>So, as you begin down your own path, tune out the naysayers, and anyone who would offer you anything other than encouragement.&nbsp; In this life, you'll not find a cause more worthy than serving the public in their time of need.</p>
