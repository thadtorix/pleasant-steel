<p>This is probably a good time to throw out the reminder that, while my stories are inspired by actual events, they are works of fiction. I hope you enjoy them. Enough disclaimer, on with the story....</p>

<p>If you've ever seen the movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102493/">My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys</a>, then you know the kind of man I'm writing about, but I'm already getting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>Our days starts the usual way, with sarge handing out information and assignments. As briefing ends, a dispatcher walks in, "Hey, we've got a guy downtown causing a disturbance".</p>

<p>Another officer and I head towards this disturbance. Sometimes, in the few minutes before you get to a scene, you just can't help but anticipate what you're headed into. Will alcohol be involved? Will he be a pleasant "happy" drunk, or a mean and difficult one?</p>

<p>My thoughts are interrupted as I pull on scene and talk with the guys who called us. "He's not really messing with us man, but that guy needs some help."</p>

<p>"That guy" is a man I'll call Tom. Tom looks like he just walked out of a Western from a few decades back. Old fashioned "Western" shirt complete with ivory snaps, worn jeans, a well used cowboy hat and a pair of boots that are probably older than I am. Tom is a thin fella and his breath confirms what I've already been told: Tom has just left a local tavern.</p>

<p>A veteran law enforcement officer stops by and fills us in on where to find Tom's family. A quick phone call and Tom's ride is headed our direction, but won't be here for thirty minutes. Admittedly, my first thought was, "Great. Just what I wanted to spend a half-hour doing." What I didn't know then, was the next thirty minutes would afford me a glimpse of something great.</p>

<p>People who know me, know I just can't keep from talking to folks. Some days seem to prove this trait to be my best, and my worst. Today, it served me, and Tom, well.</p>

<p>From his age to his outfit, everything about Tom tells me that he is part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation">Greatest Generation</a>. A generation of Men and Women that are quickly fading into history.</p>

<p>"Were you in the War, Tom?" For the first time in our encounter, I see Tom's eyes sharpen as they seem to snap to a clear memory that defies the bourbon he's had.</p>

<p>"Y'Know, I just don't talk about that much." He replies with a soft tone.</p>

<p>I'm not sure just where my question took Tom, but he spent a few minutes there, his eyes lost in the distance. A minute or two pass, his eyes well up without giving up a single tear, and Tom snaps back to the present by trying to explain the "disturbance" that spurred a police response.</p>

<p>"Tom, where'd you get that shirt? It looks brand new!" This time, my question opens up a world from Tom's past that he is happy to share. I stand there with Tom while he tells story after story of his rodeo days. His eyes are still focused on his memories, but I'd swear I saw a sparkle in them as he spoke. Tom filled the next twenty minutes with story after story of bareback bronc and bull riding, beating a national champion or two, and breaking some of the toughest horses ever heard of.</p>

<p>Tom was just getting started when his buddy showed up, thanked us for looking after Tom, and drove him home. After a quick chat with Tom's friend, I drove down to the bar where it turns out Tom is well known.</p>

<p>The twenty or so patrons lined up around the bar fell silent as a uniformed officer walked in. I found the manager and asked if he knew Tom.</p>

<p>"Just the local drunk!" snapped a lady seated at the bar.</p>

<p>I turned to face her as each customer heard my response, "I can see why you'd think that ma'am, but the man I just spoke with was a hero, from a war we've forgotten too quickly. When the war was over, he went on to spend decades as a rodeo cowboy. A tougher man than I'll ever be who knows exactly what it is to fight for freedom. I'm just here trying to help make sure he finds a ride home next time he stops in for a drink."</p>

<p>It's even quieter in the bar now as I provide the number for Tom's ride to the bartender, who pins it to the wall and promises to find him a ride next time. I head for the door and the "Thank-You's" start from the patrons who have been listening. "I'm not the one who has earned your gratitude," I remind, "next time Tom stops in... thank him." A few smiling faces assure me Tom won't have any trouble finding a ride next time he's had a couple.</p>

<p>A few days later I saw Tom again down by the lake, staring off into the distance while fishing. Just can't help but wonder where his mind's eye has taken him.</p>

<p>When you're a cop, there's an awful lot of nonsense to wade through. Some of it comes from the citizens you serve, and some from inside the walls of the department. It's easy to become a bit too jaded and lose track of what this profession is all about.</p>

<p>This disturbance call has reminded me once again that this job of mine is not just some <em>burden</em> I carry, it's a <em>privilege</em> I've been granted.</p>
