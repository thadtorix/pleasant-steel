<p>There is a smell I have come to fear. An odor I recognize instantly, which exists in only one circumstance. The odor that surrounds a fatal vehicle crash is so distinct to me I will never forget it.</p>

<p>In the time that has passed since my first job in an ambulance almost twenty years ago, I have worked on and forgotten hundreds of patients. Somehow though, I think I recall something about each fatality wreck. As a very young EMT (I was 18 years old) back home I remember the first time I saw death in such a manner. The freeway was ice covered and there had been a rollover where multiple adults and children had been involved, some of them ejected from the vehicle. I was worthless for anything more than making trips to the unit to retrieve supplies for the more veteran EMS providers. I remember stepping over what seemed like an enormous pond of blood and tissue, only later realizing it belonged to the man lying dead on the asphalt.</p>

<p>I remember that call was terrible. I remember that smell. Twisted and crushed metal combined with now lifeless people that had also been twisted and crushed in unnatural ways. I had been an EMT for a few months at that point. That call was almost my last.</p>

<p>Several years later I had moved half way across the Country and went to work for a much bigger EMS service than I was used to. It wasn't long before I was headed with my partner to work a vehicle vs. pedestrian accident on a major highway. This poor soul was struck by several vehicles and was now barely recognizable as a human being. We were there only for a few minutes to confirm that there was nothing that could be done. In that short time that same smell poured into my nostrils.</p>

<p>I finally earned my own Paramedic patch and in no time at all I was out on my own with my brand new EMT partner. Just a few weeks afterwards, some sad soul stepped into the path of a train. I never even saw the patient, as they were so mangled and entangled that they had to be removed in pieces. I never saw the patient, but I smelled that same smell.</p>

<p>On a beautiful spring day on the outskirts of a college town, two 18 year old ladies were driving their car and enjoying life as new university students. They didn't see the stop sign, or the oncoming dump truck, and pulled directly into the path of the truck less than a second before impact. As we waited for the firefighters to remove the roof of the car, I could already smell that unmistakable odor. Seeing each of them confirmed what we already knew. The physics of mass and momentum didn't give these ladies a chance for survival. My partner on this call requested we go straight back to the station. He remarked about this kind of work not being worth what we were paid. I backed our rig into the station and he quietly got out. I never saw him again.</p>

<p>I spent a few years as a flight paramedic where I had more than my fair share of flights to extremely bad accidents. I learned to focus on what good we could do, but on plenty of flights I still caught a whiff of that unmistakable odor. My nose telling me what the ground crews were confirming, some in this accident were fatally injured.</p>

<p>Not too long ago, my colleagues and I worked a terrible accident that claimed at least one life. On our way to the scene, my partner confided that this would be their first bad accident of this type. I mentioned that I always smell a distinct odor on fatality accidents. Our tasks included taking several patients to the hospital and after each patient was in a room I found my partner in tears. I'm convinced the small chapel in our Emergency Room is as much for staff as it is for families of patients. We sat in that chapel long enough to have a good cry and to gently put things in perspective, and then followed things up with a proper debriefing a few days later. Sitting in that chapel, I could still smell that same odor from the accident scene we'd just left.</p>

<p>So for me, this smell, this gut wrenching odor, has become more than just a foul scent. For me, it is a reminder to pause and reconsider a few things. My career. My relationships. My plans.</p>

<p>That odor has become as a sounding signal that proclaims: "We are not guaranteed tomorrow." It is the smell of stolen tomorrows, perhaps. Whatever it is, I hate it.</p>
