<p>Probably the most valuable piece of advice I have received as a rookie cop is, “Watch people’s hands. See their hands before you see their eyes. Friend or foe, it’s their hands that will hurt you.”</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I told my dad about a recent traffic stop. The story goes like this:<br /><!--cut--></p>

<p>I stop a small white car for speeding, about 15 miles per hour over the limit. The driver pulls into a parking lot and turns off the ignition. As I approach the car, I notice three kids in the back seat; two little girls and a small boy, each under eight years old or so. All three of the children are sound asleep.</p>

<p>I stand just behind the Driver’s door, notice he isn’t wearing his seat belt, and begin with the standard, “The reason I stopped you today is….”</p>

<p>While I’m speaking I notice the driver’s hands. The second I see his hands, I know what he does for a living. Although I have not met this man before, I have seen his hands before. I’m sure of it.</p>

<p>I look inside the car and see the front seat passenger sitting quietly; she looks like she has plenty to say, just not to me.</p>

<p>I ask where they are headed. Mr. Adams explains they live about an hour away and have come to town to visit his wife’s favorite restaurant.</p>

<p>I ask him to wait, while I return to my patrol car and check his license. Everything checks out normal.</p>

<p>A warning for fifteen over in town is rare from me. Ticket book in hand, I glance up at the car one more time.</p>

<p>When I was a boy, we had a small white four door car. I spent countless hours in the back seat of that car next to my sisters. But it’s not the car or the kids that I find familiar. It’s the driver’s hands.</p>

<p>I set my ticket book down and walk back to the car. “Mr. Adams, may I ask what you do for a living sir?”</p>

<p>“I’m a mechanic.” He replies with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>“I thought so.” I say. “When I was a kid, my Dad worked as a mechanic. I’ve never seen a man work harder to provide for his family in my life. If I’m right, it took a long time to earn the extra money to pay for a night out. No need to spend that money on a traffic ticket - You’re getting a warning today. Try to slow it down please.”</p>

<p>Mr. Adams is still staring at me when I remember his seat belt. “One more thing...” I glance towards the back seat and continue, “These little ones are going to need you around for a while yet, and I’d bet your wife would just as soon keep you around, so put that seat belt on okay?”</p>

<p>Mr. Adams’ eyes are a little bit bigger now, and I just might see a tear forming. He extends his hand slowly to shake mine as he says, “Thank-You. Thank-You very much!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams is still quiet, but she’s wearing a warm smile now.</p>

<p>A window rolls down as I am leaving the parking lot. I ask, “You’re wondering how I knew you were a mechanic?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It’s your hands. I’ve seen those hands a thousand times. Those are the hands of a man who has worked hard to provide for his family. You folks enjoy your dinner.”</p>

<p>I pull into a lot a few blocks down and call my Dad. I tell him about this traffic stop. I know he’ll enjoy the story and I want him to hear how thankful I am for all the hard work he has invested in our lives. I hear the unmistakable sound of my Dad fighting back tears, and I can tell he’s smiling as we talk.</p>

<p>I suppose there are many professions that will leave a person’s hands the way they left Dad’s. Clean, but still showing the day’s work. Hard work has left a lasting mark on Dad’s hands, and a lifelong impression on his children.</p>
